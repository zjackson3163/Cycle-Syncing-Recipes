        <p>Research shows that eating certain foods during various phases of the menstrual cycle help your body to produce or release hormones the hormones needed during different phases. Eating this way can possibly hep to control PMS symptoms. While it all boils down to eating healthier, less inflammatory foods. I found that it helps me to narrow down recipes if I eat by what phase I'm in. This website was created as a personal project to keep track of recipes that help hormones during different phases of the menstrual cycle.</p>

        <p>To use this website simply click which phase you'd like to see recipes for and a list of "phase-friendly" recipes will be listed. Below will be a rundown of what season the body is in and what ingredients will help you in each phase. There is also a tab in the navigation bar for articles or books that I found interesting while learning if you'd like to do more research.</p>
