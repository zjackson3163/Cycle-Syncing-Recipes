        <h1>Breakdown of Each Phase </h1>
        <p class = "para">Below is a breakdown of each phase, the processes your body is going through and foods that may help! The research is mostly from "In the FLO by Alissa Vitti".</p>
        <!--Will add actual resources and format better later !-->

        <h3>Menstrual (Winter)</h3>
        <p class= "info">+ The Menstrual phase is the first phase of your period. The bleeding. This usually lasts from 3-5 days but can be anywhere from 2-7. The following is quoted from "In the FLO by Alissa Vitti..."Your hormone levels are at their lowest during menstruation, but you can compensate by increasing your intake of protein and healthy fats. Doing so will keep your energy and moods stable while your brain adjusts to the downshift in hormones. [...] When your body is involved in the intense process of menstruation--shedding the built-up lining of the uterus--it's especially important to turn your focus to nutrient-dense foods, such as red meat, kidney beans, and buckwheat. According to traditional Chinese medicine, this is the coldest part of the cycle, so warming foods are ideal during this phase. Protein, fats, veggies, and fruits with a low glycemic index--think blueberries and blackberries--keep your blood sugar steady while adding fiber and antioxidants. Seafood, kelp, and nori can help re-mineralize your body with iron and zinc, which you lose during menstruation. These foods are deeply restorative to the blood and kidneys and are ideal while your bleeding."  </p>

        <h3>Follicular (Spring)</h3>
        <p class= "info">+ The Follicular phase is the second phase of your period and your body's spring. The follicular phase technically starts the first day of your period and ends on the day of ovulation, however, for the purpose of eating for your cycle phase we'll say it starts the day after your period ends and ends 2 days before ovulation, so about 5 days. The following is quoted from "In the FLO: Alissa Vitti"..."Fresh, vibrant, light foods make you feel more energized during this phase when all hormone levels are beginning to rise. This week you'll want to focus on those phytoestrogens--plant-based compounds that mimic the body's natural estrogen. You wouldn't want to eat them when you already have high levels, but during this period of lower estrogen, they can be balancing and beneficial. Think pressed salads (kimchi and sauerkraut); plenty of veggies (string beans, zucchini, carrots); lean proteins (chicken, trout); sprouted beans and seeds; and nutrient-dense energy-sustaining foods like oats.  [...] The foods you consume in the follicular phase set the stage for ovulation. By eating fermented foods packed with beneficial bacteria, you're priming the microbiome and estrobolome to be ready when ovulation occurs."</p>

        <h3>Ovulation (Summer)</h3>
        <p class= "info">+ The Ovulation phase is the third phase of your period. This lasts from 3-5 days. Will add more info later...</p>

        <h3>Luteal (Fall)</h3>
        <p class= "info">+ The Luteal phase is the fourth phase of your period. This lasts from 12-14 days. Will add more info later...</p>
